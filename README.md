> <p align="justify">This code aims to be a thin,
> but with "batteries included", ETL framework.
> It is written using prominent Python frameworks such as
> <a href="https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/">Alembic</a>,
> <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a>,
> <a href="https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/">Tornado</a>
> and <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>.
> Driver behind this project was a need for a rapid ETL
> and Scraping capabilities framework that is both development and deployment
> friendly, as well as something to return to the community.
> The whole idea is obviously heavily influenced by
> <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> and
> <a href="https://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a>.
> Tested with <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> with a help of
> <a href="https://tox.wiki/en/latest/">tox</a>.</p>
