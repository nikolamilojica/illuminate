> This code aims to be a thin, but with "batteries included", ETL framework.
> It is written using prominent Python frameworks such as
> [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/),
> [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/),
> [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)
> and [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).
>
> Driver behind this project was a personal need for a rapid ETL and Scraping
> capabilities framework that is both development and deployment friendly,
> as well as to return something to the community.
>
> The whole idea is obviously heavily influenced by
> [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and
> [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/).
> Tested with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).
> Tests run with [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/).
