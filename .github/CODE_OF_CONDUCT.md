- Be friendly and patient. Don't be a person that is avoided by others.
- Two heads are smarter than one. And all the help on an open source project is
more than welcome.
- Respect fellow peer. We are all on the same journey. But we all have our
ways.
- Consider how your work will affect others. Nobody lives in a vacuum.
- Think before you write publicly. Your words may last as GitHub itself.
- Disagreement is natural, use it to make better decision instead as a vessel
to "win" arguments.
